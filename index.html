    <h1>Jinn Jae Wang</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Better yet, just call me Jinn</h2>
    <br>
    <p>At one point I was playing League of Legends in solo queue.
      After a bit I changed my stance to only playing customs with friends
      and nothing else. Best decision ever as look at this, I had the
      time and energy to make a whole functioning (horrid looking)
      website. This is what cutting league will get you, a life of
      some small incremental achievement that at least tells you you're
      capable of something a bit better.

      This is a cry for help
